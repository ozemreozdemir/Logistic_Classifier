 The Adjusted R-squared of the linear model was calculated as 0.0906336204558106 
 , which is very low. However, when we check the Mean Standard Error of the linear model, 
 MSE = 0.00550583481014612 . This value tells us  how the mean varies with different reviwes measuring the same rating. 
  It should be noted that the MSE decreases as sample size increase therefore we have a very low MSE value 
 In addition the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is obtained as 6.70123649144701
